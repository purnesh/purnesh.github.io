### About me

I am a postgraduate student at University of Auckland, currently pursuing **Master of Professional Studies** in **Data Science**. I live in Auckland, New Zealand and am expected to complete my course in June 2018. I'm also working as a Part-time **Data Engineer** at **[NarrativeMuse](http://narrativemuse.com)** where I'm helping the company find more information in the data than meets the eye.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/purnesh/purnesh.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
